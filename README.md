# BungeeGuard

BungeeGuard is a plugin which adds a security token to the BungeeCord handshaking protocol. In the case that the backend servers are not properly firewalled, it prevents players from bypassing the proxy and spoofing their UUID.

* BungeeCord installations are insecure by default, and require additional firewall rules to be configured for the backend Minecraft servers to prevent abuse from malicious users.
* This process can be complicated, and because of that many users opt to skip it or carry it out it incorrectly.
* BungeeGuard rectifies this by adding a secret security token to the handshake, allowing the backend server to verify whether a connection originated from a trusted proxy.

It is a more sensible replacement to "ip whitelist" or "only proxy join" type plugins.

### Installation

Installation is very straightforward.

#### On your BungeeCord proxies...

1. Ensure `ip_forward` is set to `true` in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
2. Add [`BungeeGuard.jar`](https://ci.lucko.me/job/BungeeGuard/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bungeeguard-universal/target/BungeeGuard.jar) to the plugins folder. Then restart the proxy. If you have multiple proxies in your network, do this for each of them.
3. Navigate to `/plugins/BungeeGuard/token.yml` and make a note of the value of `token`. 

#### On each of your backend Minecraft servers...

1. Ensure you are either using [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.9.4+ *or* have [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) installed.
2. Ensure `bungeecord` is set to `true` in `spigot.yml`.
3. Add [`BungeeGuard.jar`](https://ci.lucko.me/job/BungeeGuard/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bungeeguard-universal/target/BungeeGuard.jar) to the plugins folder. Then restart the server.
4. Navigate to `/plugins/BungeeGuard/config.yml`. Add the token(s) generated by the proxy(ies) to the `allowed-tokens` list.

	e.g.
	```yml
	# Allowed authentication tokens.  
	allowed-tokens:
	  - "AUSXEwebkOGVnbihJM8gBS0QUutDzvIG009xoAfo1Huba9pGvhfjrA21r8dWVsa8"
	```
5. Run `bungeeguard reload` from console.
